## üñ• Hosting on your own machine

So, you edited the code to your own liking and now you want to host it on your own machine? No problem! There are 3 ways of installing the bot:

1. (NOTE: This is now deprecated, use Docker instead.)
   For an automatic install, run `bash scripts/install.sh` (Linux/Unix or Windows WSL only) in the **root directory** of the project

2. For a Docker Installation, run the following command (don't ignore comments!):

   ```shell
   docker run -it $(docker build --build-args token=BOT_TOKEN -q .)  # Replace 'BOT_TOKEN' with your token.
   ```

3. Or by following the steps below for a manual installation of the bot:

   1. Clone the repository using

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/shadawcraw/Hadum.git
   cd Hadum  # Accessing the project directory
   ```

   2. To install the dependencies, Run in the root folder of the project the following command:

   ```shell
   python -m pip  --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt  # Windows
   python3 -m pip3 --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt # Windows WSL, Linux and UNIX-Like systems (OSX)
   ```

   In a Bash/ZSH shell or in Windows WSL.

   3. Then, create a file named ".env" in the **root folder** of the project.

   4. Once that is done, enter the following lines into the .env file created earlier:
      `TOKEN="[YOUR_TOKEN_HERE]"`
      Remember to put the variable name in ALL CAPS and replace the brackets and the text inside it with your own [token](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/).

   5. After that, you're all set! Run the `run.sh` file or enter `python main.py` for Windows and `python3 main.py` for Linux and Unix-like systems.
